## MVP
### 
**Breakdown of responsibilities.**  Who is in charge of what features? I.E. Eric - Create posts and comments, Troy - User account with auth and gatekeeping
**Wireframes** for *every* page you plan on creating. These don't have to be pretty; just sketch what the page will include. Do not go for an exact copy of what you are deconstructing. Think about how you could possibly improve the user experience.
**User Stories** (divided into sprints) - we recommend [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking.
**User Flow** for how the user will navigate the application.
**Database Models and ERD** Make plans for each resource. List the attributes you'll include in your schemas and what type of data each attribute will be. Draw an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=database%20table%20relationships%20drawing) to illustrate the relationship(s) between models, and note whether you plan to reference or embed related data.
A **Feasibility Check** for any bonus feature you'd like to complete (Example: image uploads via 3rd storage solution).
